# History
view your google history for the last week - then send to a trusted friend

## About
This program prevents me from wasting time. Every week, my trusted partner, Yehudit, expects an e-mail with my Google history. During the week, I'm careful about where I go because Big Sister is watching. If this program can help you - enjoy!!

## Dependencies
To use this program, you need the export history extension, which will give you your google history as a json file. Get it for free from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-history/hcohnnbbiggngobheobhdipbgmcbelhh 

## Using this project
1. Clone the project to your GitHub account.
2. Save your history file as history.json in the project folder, replacing the current history.json file.
3. In your settings, enable GitHub pages. GitHub will give you the address of your live site.
4. Visit the GitHub Pages link and check out your results!

## Hopes and dreams
When I have time, I want to add some features:
- An 'on-target' area, which you can check off to see if current search was work related, with a calculation at the bottom of how much of your time is spent on work.
- A 'most-visited' area, where you can see which sites you check WAY too often.

## contributing
I feel very attached to this project because it is improving my life every day! If you have comments, questions, complaints, or old song lyrics to share - please submit a pull request.
